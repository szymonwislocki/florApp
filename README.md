## florApp

Currently I work on app that will be able to control Fibaro smart-home appliances through communiaction with API provided by Fibaro(https://manuals.fibaro.com/knowledge-base-browse/rest-api/).

As of the 27th November - this app successfully renders room list and device list and also giving able to control lights in house. Probably, in the near future, it will be unable to add control of thermostats, because API's `action` section is very poor.

What else can I add to app is rendering notifiactions (e.g. low battery of thermostate or temperature sensor) and few suggestions like "Turn on light in living room" after sunset hour or "Turn off some lights" when there are too many lights in one room are turned on.

In the near future I'm going to add demo mode with mock API for preview purposes.
